# POSEFIT: YOUR PERSONALIZED PATH TO TOTAL WELLNESS
             






**ABSTRACT**

PoseFit is a modern health and wellness platform built to help people stay fit—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or you're already deep into it, PoseFit offers personalized tools to support your goals. Using advanced technology like OpenCV and MediaPipe, our Pose Analysis feature gives real-time feedback on your workout form to help you move better and stay injury-free. For nutrition and fitness advice, our AI chatbots (powered by Groq LLaMA 4) provide customized plans and tips tailored just for you.

But fitness isn’t just about the body—it’s also about the mind. That’s why our Mental Wellness section includes handpicked YouTube videos for meditation, yoga, and mindfulness practices, along with the option to book a session with an expert when you need a little extra support. To keep things fun and motivating, PoseFit includes daily challenges that reward you with points when you complete them. And if you’ve had injuries in the past, you can easily track them in the Injury History section to better understand your recovery and progress.

PoseFit brings everything together in one place to help you live a healthier, more balanced life.

## Problem Statement:

In today’s fast-paced and digitally driven world, maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle has become increasingly challenging. Individuals often struggle with fragmented fitness resources—juggling separate apps for workouts, nutrition guidance, mental wellness, and injury tracking. This lack of integration leads to inconsistent user engagement, limited personalization, and poor adherence to wellness routines.

Moreover, many fitness platforms lack real-time feedback on physical form, resulting in improper exercise execution and a higher risk of injury. Similarly, generalized diet and workout plans fail to meet individual needs, while mental wellness support is often overlooked or not easily accessible. The absence of a unified, intelligent system that caters to the complete spectrum of wellness—physical, nutritional, and mental—creates a gap in the user’s fitness journey.

PoseFit addresses this problem by providing an all-in-one platform that combines pose analysis, AI-powered fitness and nutrition chatbots, mental wellness support, gamified challenges, and injury tracking. By centralizing these essential components, PoseFit empowers users to take control of their health with personalized, data-driven, and engaging tools—bridging the gap between technology and holistic well-being.
